    description: "'We offer full service moving and storage solutions with full time, experienced, and well-trained crews and a fleet of distinctive, late model, well maintained trucks. Amazing Moves provides the range of services you'd expect from the large national movers but we're nimble and flexible enough to provide customized Denver moving and storage services at a competitive price. Big national moving and storage companies (usually through an out of state call center) too often dictate the details of your move - whether it's timing, shared loads, or delivery schedules. Our core values include making efficient use of our customers' time. Amazing Moves' goal is to change the image of moving and storage companies. We take the term \"full service moving and storage\" seriously and literally. We serve both residential and commercial clients. When it comes to packing, moving, and storage, Amazing Moves uses state of the art material and techniques, including specialized packing services for valuables, breakables, antiques, and fine art and for unique objects like pianos. We've seen it all and moved it all - safely. Our climate controlled storage solutions include long and short term arrangements. When you're looking for Denver movers that offer small company attention and service but big company expertise, Amazing Moves Moving & Storage is the best option for moving and storage services in Denver and the Front Range area of Colorado.'"
